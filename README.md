It's a Jupyter notebook, but GitHub will automatically render it
in a few seconds.

Why am I using this weird format? Am I using GitHub and Jupyter for
my blog? Yes, exactly. GitHub is a great free hosting service, and
lets me use git for revision control. I can edit my stuff on my
local computer, and push it up to GitHub when I'm done.

Jupyter? It provides markdown, including inline equations and code,
which are useful for some of my articles.

So, it's just a little bit awkward for you, dear reader, but quite
convenient for me.
